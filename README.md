My model loads 3 classes of lung cancer images, preprocesses them by resizing and normalizing, and then trains a Convolutional Neural Network. The CNN has 3 convolutional blocks followed by dense layers and dropout. I trained the model for 10 epochs and achieved about 92% accuracy on unseen test images. This demonstrates that CNNs are effective for classifying histopathology lung tissue images for cancer detection
